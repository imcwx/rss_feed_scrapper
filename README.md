# RSS Feed Data Scrapper
By tracking RSS Feed, we are able to scrap data from some sites.
This is a test of concept and only implemented to Straits Time RSS Feed.

Since it is successful, it should be applicable to expand to various sites with RSS Feed.

- Added CNA feed but have not done full run.


Other things to add:
- Parallel runs for various feeds or just leave it for different 'bots' or 'servers' to run individually.
